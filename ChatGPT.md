# ChatGPT

**ChatGPT** is an **AI-based chatbot** that interacts with users using **text or voice**. 

## Chatbot

A **chatbot** is a computer program that allows us to communicate with machines like we do with people.

Chatbots come in two types:

---

## Types of Chatbots

### 1. Rule-Based Chatbot
- These are pre-defined and work on specific **keywords** or **options**.
- They respond only within the limited rules set by their creators.
- **Example**: When you call customer care, you hear:
  > “Press 1 to know your Balance, Press 2 to update your Account, Press 3 to go back to the main menu.”

### 2. AI-Based Chatbot
- These are more flexible and understand **natural human language**.
- They respond in a way that feels like you're chatting with a real person.
- **Example**: ChatGPT by OpenAI, which can talk about **anything** like general knowledge, programming, writing, technology, sports, etc.

## How Does ChatGPT Use NLP?

**NLP (Natural Language Processing)** is a method that helps AI understand and respond to human language.  
ChatGPT uses NLP in the following five steps:

1. **Tokenization** – Breaks down the sentence into individual words.
2. **Intent Recognition** – Understands what the user wants to do or say.
3. **Named Entity Recognition** – Identifies key information like names, places, or objects.
4. **Context Understanding** – Understands the overall situation using past references.
5. **Response Generation & Output** – Creates and provides a meaningful response.

## What is ChatGPT?

- **Chat** = A system that communicates like a human using natural language.  
- **GPT** = **Generative Pre-trained Transformer**  
  It’s an AI model that generates human-like text.  
  “Generative” means it creates, “Pre-trained” means it has learned from a huge amount of data, and “Transformer” is the technique used behind the scenes.

## How Was ChatGPT Created?

- Created by **OpenAI**, a research-based company focused on building **safe and useful AI**.
- Steps followed:
  1. Collected huge datasets from books, websites, articles, etc.
  2. Trained different AI models: **GPT-1, GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-4, GPT-4.5**
  3. Taught these models to understand and respond in natural language.

## ChatGPT Training Process

1. **Pre-Training**  
   - Trained on billions of sentences to understand grammar, logic, facts, and what word likely comes next.

2. **Fine-Tuning**  
   - Adjusted using human feedback to improve its accuracy and usefulness.

3. **Reinforcement Learning**  
   - Uses feedback from real users to make future responses better.
